# Prompts for Describing AI Use Cases

Welcome to the "Prompts for Describing AI Use Cases" repository! This repository contains a collection of prompts designed to help workshop participants systematically create and describe AI use cases. 

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured approach for brainstorming, categorizing, and describing AI use cases. By using these prompts, participants can effectively explore AI applications in various business processes and develop well-defined use cases.
